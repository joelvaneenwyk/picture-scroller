<h2><!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica" color="#3366FF">Making
a Picture Your Background (Wallpaper)<!--mstheme--></font></h2>
<!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica">
<p>At any time while you're scrolling through pictures, you have the option to
make the picture that is currently being shown become your background.&nbsp; To do this, start by pressing the
&quot;F3&quot; key on your keyboard.&nbsp; A window will appear allowing you to
choose to &quot;Copy Picture to Windows Directory&quot; or &quot;Use Picture
from Current Location&quot;.</p>
<!--mstheme--></font>
<h4><!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica" color="#330099">Copy
Picture to Windows Directory<!--mstheme--></font></h4>
<!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica">
<p>This means that instead of directly making this picture your background, the
picture
is first copied into your Windows directory.&nbsp; This way, if the picture is
no longer available for some reason (such as, if the picture was on a CD),
Windows can still continue to use the picture as your background.&nbsp; However,
if the picture is actually on your hard-drive, you probably don't want to use
this option, because, in copying the picture, you would have two copies of the
same picture on your computer.</p>
<!--mstheme--></font>
<h4><!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica" color="#330099">New
File Name<!--mstheme--></font></h4>
<!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica">
<p>When using the above option, the file name that the copy will
go by is shown here.&nbsp; Typically, you don't need to change this; the default
value should work just fine.</p>
<!--mstheme--></font>
<h4><!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica" color="#330099">Use
Picture From Current Location<!--mstheme--></font></h4>
<!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica"><p>This is just the opposite of the option above.&nbsp; Using this, Picture
Scroller will directly make the current picture your background.&nbsp; You
should probably use this option if the pictures you're scrolling through are
already on
your hard-drive.&nbsp; One exception to this, however, is if the picture you've
selected is <i>not </i>in bitmap format.&nbsp; In this case, you must use the
previous option, because Windows does not support any picture format except
bitmap for use as wallpaper .</p>
<p>After you've selected from these options, click &quot;OK&quot;.&nbsp; </p>
