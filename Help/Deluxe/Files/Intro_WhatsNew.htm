<h2><!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica" color="#3366FF">What's New Since 1.0<!--mstheme--></font></h2>

<!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica">
<p>Since the release of Picture Scroller 1.0 on March 25, 2000, Picture Scroller
has undergone massive changes.&nbsp; The new Picture Scroller 2.0 features many
additions, as
well as changes to the old.&nbsp; For changes in version 2.1, see below.</p>

<ul>
  <li><h4>A Fresh, Intuitive Look</h4></li>
</ul>
  <p style="margin-left: 40; margin-top: 0">As of this release, Picture Scroller
    has undergone a massive facelift.&nbsp; With its step-by-step design, now all you have
    to do is follow the buttons on the left part of the main screen, and you'll be
    up and scrolling in no time!&nbsp; Besides that, Picture Scroller also features a
    much-improved help system, enabling you to get the most out of Picture
    Scroller.&nbsp; Whenever you want to know what something does, just move your
    mouse over it to see a description at the bottom of the Picture Scroller
    screen.&nbsp; If that's not enough, press the F1 key on your keyboard for more
    information.</p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Support for Multiple Folders</h4></li>
</ul>
  <p style="margin-left: 40; margin-top: 0">Instead of selecting just one folder at a time,
    now you can scroll through all the pictures from more than one place
    simultaneously!&nbsp; This also includes the ability to save lists of chosen
    pictures for future viewing.&nbsp; <a href="Common/Options_SelectPictures.htm">More Information</a></p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Set the Exact Order of the Pictures</h4></li>
</ul>
  <p style="margin-left: 40; margin-top: 0">Why let Picture Scroller determine the
    viewing order of the pictures for you? In Picture Scroller 2.0, you can decide
    not only what pictures are shown, but also in what order they will appear.&nbsp; <a href="Common/Options_SelectPictures.htm">More Information</a></p>

  <p style="margin-left: 40; margin-top: 0">With this feature, you can look
    over the pictures you've chosen before scrolling through them, helping you to
    determine the best possible scrolling order.&nbsp; <a href="Options_Preview.htm">More Information</a></p>
<ul>
  <li><h4> More Picture Formats</h4></il></li>

</ul>
  <p style="margin-left: 40; margin-top: 0">This version of Picture Scroller now
    comes packed with <i><b>50</b></i> transitions to choose from, more than double that of the previous version!&nbsp;
    Among the most notable are the new circle transitions.&nbsp; <a href="Options_AdjOpt_Transitions.htm">More Information</a></p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Use as a Screen Saver</h4></li>
</ul>
  <p style="margin-left: 40; margin-top: 0">Being able to scroll through your vacation photos is one thing, but how about having your
    computer <i>automatically</i> scroll through those pictures every time you're
    away from your computer, so that when you come back, you see one of those
    special memories sliding gently across the screen?&nbsp; <i>That</i> is pure satisfaction!&nbsp;
    Now with the Picture Scroller 2.0 Screen Saver feature, you can!&nbsp; <a href="ScrSaver_Using.htm">More Information</a></p>

<!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica">
<p>Picture Scroller 2.1 fixes various graphical &quot;glitches&quot; that appear when 
using Picture Scroller on Windows 2000 or XP.&nbsp; In particular, when 
scrolling through pictures in &quot;Proportional&quot; and &quot;Screen Size&quot; mode, pictures no 
longer have black lines or dots scattered across each picture.&nbsp; Also, 
pictures appear very crisp when viewing their preview, both when selecting 
pictures and in Print Preview.</p>
