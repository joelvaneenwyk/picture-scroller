Pictures<!--mstheme--></font></h2>
<!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica">
<p>This section explains the various options available when choosing your
pictures.&nbsp; To view these options, click the &quot;Select Pictures&quot;
button on the left side of the main Picture Scroller screen.&nbsp; At this
point, the right side of the screen will change to show various buttons along the
top with a blank area below.&nbsp; Initially, this blank area will display a list of
the <img border="0" src="../Graphics/Folder.gif"> folders of pictures as you select them.&nbsp;
If you want to see a list of the pictures
inside a folder, double-click that folder.&nbsp; To return to the list of
folders, double-click the <img border="0" src="../Graphics/UpLevel.gif"> at the top of the
list.</p>

<h4><!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica" color="#330099">Add<!--mstheme--></font></h4>
<!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica">
<p>The &quot;Add&quot; button is the first in the series along the top.&nbsp; Clicking this
button will reveal a list of options relating, quite obviously, to adding
pictures.&nbsp; The first option, &quot;Directory&quot;, allows you to add an
entire directory of pictures, including pictures in directories
within the selected directory (sub-folders).&nbsp; The second option, &quot;File(s)&quot;,
allows you to add individual pictures, one by one or as a group (<A HREF="JavaScript:HHCtrl.TextPopup(MultiFiles,PopFont,9,9,-1,-1)"Title="Click for tip.">Tip</a>).</p>
<p>Picture Scroller supports many of the major picture formats,
including bitmap (.bmp), JPEG (.jpg), GIF (.gif), PCX (.pcx), and Photoshop (.psd)
pictures.&nbsp; For a complete list of all the formats supported, click <a href="../SupportedFormats.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p>The next two options, namely &quot;Load Saved List&quot; and &quot;Save
Current List&quot;, allow you to save in one file a list of all the pictures that you have
added.&nbsp; For example, let's say you have one hundred
Yellowstone pictures that you've saved from different vacations over the past 5
years.&nbsp; Instead of having to add all those pictures each time you want to
scroll through them, you could add them once, save them as a separate list, and
load them from the list each time you want to enjoy them.&nbsp; To do this,
just follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Add and organize all the pictures that you want using any of the methods
    given.</li>
  <li>Select &quot;Add&quot;, and click &quot;Save Current List&quot;.
    <p style="margin-top: 1">At this point, you are asked to specify where you
    would like to save the list.&nbsp; After typing in a descriptive name,
    click &quot;OK&quot;.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
    <p style="margin-top: 0">Now that you've saved the list, every time you want
    to scroll through them, do this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
Select &quot;Add&quot;, and click &quot;Load Saved List&quot;.
  <li>
    <p style="margin-top: 1">This time, just select the file you previously saved
    and click &quot;OK&quot;.</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-top: 10">Immediately, your pictures will be loaded into the
list, ready for use!</p>

<h4><!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica" color="#330099">Delete<!--mstheme--></font></h4>
<!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica">
<p>The next button after &quot;Add&quot; is the &quot;Delete&quot; button.&nbsp;
Clicking this removes the selected picture(s) from the list.&nbsp; If the list
is showing&nbsp;folders (see above for explanation) and you select one of these,
the entire folder of pictures will be removed from the list.&nbsp; On the other
hand, if you only want to remove individual pictures, first double-click on the
folder, and then delete the specific pictures. (<A HREF="JavaScript:HHCtrl.TextPopup(MultiFiles,PopFont,9,9,-1,-1)"Title="Click for tip.">Tip</a>) </p>

<h4><!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica" color="#330099">Move
Up/Move Down<!--mstheme--></font></h4>
<!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica">
<p>These two buttons to the right of &quot;Delete&quot; allow you to adjust the
scrolling order of the pictures.&nbsp; Instead of simply having Picture Scroller
set the order for you, you can use these buttons to move a picture up or down in
the scrolling order, say, for example, into chronological order.&nbsp; To do
this, just select a picture (or folder) and click one of these buttons.</p>
<p>NOTE: You <i>cannot </i>use the SHIFT key or the CTRL key to move more than one picture at a
time.</p>
<!--mstheme--></font>
<h4><!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica" color="#330099">View<!--mstheme--></font></h4>
<!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica">
<p>Clicking this button, allows you to quickly look at a picture.&nbsp;
After clicking &quot;View&quot;, a white box appears just below the main
buttons on the left side of the screen.&nbsp; When you click on a picture from
the list, this box changes to show a preview of the picture.</p>
