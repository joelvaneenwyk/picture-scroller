LICENSE
-------
Simply stated, Picture Scroller 2.1 Lite is free to be used by you or anyone
else you may choose to give it to.  The complete license agreement can be
found in the file named "License.txt".

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------
Operating System:	Windows 95, 98, or 2000

			Picture Scroller has been verified to work on these systems,
			but may also work on Windows NT and most certainly should
			work on Windows Me.  For optimum performance, Windows 98 or
			greater is recommended.

DirectX:		DirectX 7.0 or greater

			If you are running Windows 95, 98, or NT but have not
			previously installed this version of DirectX, you will need
			to download it from Microsoft's site (see below).

Internet Explorer:	Internet Explorer 4.0 or later

			If you are running Windows 95 without Internet Explorer 4.0
			or greater, you will need to install it.  See below for the
			link to the Microsoft site for download information.

CPU, Video card, etc:	As with any graphics related program, the better the system
			(a higher Mhz CPU, a better Video card, etc.) the better
			Picture Scroller will run.  Nevertheless, Picture Scroller
			has been successfully tested on a Pentium 60Mhz CPU with a
			1MB Video card.
